# Chat-server-using-socket-and-XMPP

SUMMARY -
1. Deployed a chat server and implemented communication between multiple clients using sockets
2. Developed the chat environment using Oracle VM VirtualBox and Python programming language
3. Implemented the chat application using XMPP with Pidgin being used as the XMPP client and Ejabberd as the XMPP server
4. Executed the application by using Linux as the server OS and Windows as the client OS

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS -
Software provides relation between human and computer. Various software and technologies  needed in this project are as follows:
1. Operating Systems - This project has been implemented successfully with Windows OS acting as a server and a Linux VM (VM instance) running on a Windows OS as a client. 
2. Programming language - Python (Any language of choice can be used)
3. Understanding of the following protocols - 
a. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) - A open source protocol for instant messaging, video call, etc. that operates on XMPP client and XMPP server.
